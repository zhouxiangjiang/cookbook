## MyPyUnit

This file contains MyPyUnit - My own unit testing framework, based on Erich
Gamma's JUnit and Kent Beck's Smalltalk testing framework.

Simple Usage:

    import my_pyunit

    class XXXTest(my_pyunit.TestCase):
        def setUp(self):
            # setting up testing

        def tearDown(self):
            # cleanup testing

        def test_methodxxx(self):
            # test method names begin 'test_*'

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        suite = my_pyunit.TestSuite()

        suite.addTestCaseFromClass(XXXTest)
        or
        suite.addTestCase(XXXTest())

        suite.run()

    many test methods as are needed. When instantiating such a TestCase
    subclass, specify in the constructor arguments the name of the test method
    that the instance is to execute.

    Test authors should subclass TestCase for their own tests. Construction
    and clean up of the test's environment ('fixture') can be implemented
    by overriding the 'setUp' and 'tearDown' methods respectively.

    If it is necessary to override the __init__ method, the base class
    __init__ method must always be called. It is important that subclasses
    should not change the signature of their __init__ method, since instances
    of the classes are instantiated automatically by parts of the framework
    in order to be run.
