Docstring Testing Cookbook.

The `doctest` module searches for pieces of documents that look like
interactive Python sessions, and then executes those sessions to verify that
they work exactly as shown. There are several common ways to use `doctest`:

    - To check that a module's docstrings are up-to-date by verifying that all
      interactive examples still work as documented.
      
    - To perform regression testing by verifying that interactive examples
      from a test file or a test object work as expected.
    
    - To write tutorial documentation for a package, liberally illustrated
      with input-output examples. Depending on whether the examples or the
      expository text are emphasized, this has the flavor of "executable
      documentation".
